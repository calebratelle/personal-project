          "content": "When life or others hurt you, overwhelm your skill at making things safe, and leave you disoriented and afraid, it's called trauma. There are two types of trauma: catastrophic trauma or incremental trauma.\nTrauma is catastrophic when it is a sudden, intense incident. For example, an attack against you, a death, or an earthquake would all be considered catastrophic traumas. Incremental traumas, on the other hand, occur repetitively in less intense ways. Things like bullying, neglect, verbal abuse, or threat of injury are examples of incremental traumas.\nIn both kinds of trauma, you may become overwhelmed. Hard things happen. No question—trauma will happen to all of us. However, we also make things hard.",

          "content": "Trauma is an external source of hard things, but difficulty also comes from within us. Internally, difficulty comes from the wrong nervous system being in charge, our negative emotional memories, and our dysfunctional behavioral memories.\nWe don't choose the trauma that happens to us. We do choose, however, whether we react with the sympathetic nervous system that closes and constricts, or whether we learn to respond with the parasympathetic nervous system that opens and engages.\nFurther, when we have a situation that we don't know what to do with, we store the memory of the event in our emotional memory files. When we have an experience that feels similar in the future, the old memories come flooding back from our emotional memory system.\nHave you ever asked yourself, why am I getting mad about something so little? Why am I getting anxious about something that is not a big deal? The reason we get emotionally hijacked is because our emotional memory is doing its job. This is what people are referring to when they discuss being “triggered,” “flooded,” or “emotionally hijacked.”\nThis additional emotional burden makes the present-day challenges much more difficult. Our purpose in this course is to simplify your memories, so you just deal with today's demands and not the emotional memories of the past. We are going to begin untangling these past negative emotional experiences and resolving them in an effective and efficient way.\nAdditionally, related to your hard emotional memories are your unhealthy behavioral memories, or the memories of how you do things. These patterns of the way you do things when you are under stress are also stored in a non-verbal way, with related behavior patterns linked together.\nThe problem with these unhealthy behavioral patterns is that they are not successful. These are the ways you did things that did not make the situation more healthy. We are going to begin confronting and resolving these behavioral memories",

You will then problem-solve the hard experience with the Commitment Tool.\nDays 2-4: You will go through a guided imagery once each day to implement the actions and/or words in the hard experience to change your emotional and behavioral memory. This may seem shocking or impossible. It is not.\nWe will repeat the above process for five hard experiences that *currently give you distress* when you remember them.\n**The purpose of this course is to put your past hard experiences in order, so they no longer influence or intrude into your present moment. Change the moment, change your day. Change your day, change your life. Let's go!**",

          "content": "Many people struggle with engaging in the moment because of their painful pasts. They are simply too preoccupied with the past to focus on the present. Or, many people ignore the pain they've experienced in the past, preferring to bury or disassociate from the trauma instead of dealing with it directly. Either way, when traumatic memories trickle forward, they can strongly push you into a downward spiral.\nIn order to combat the difficult memories of our pasts, there are simple rules for changing them. In order to change an emotional memory, we:\n     1. Confront the painful experience.\n     2. Add real facts or truths that were possible, but not included, at the time the memory was formed.\n     3. Run the memory with the new truth included.\nToday, you will use a Circle Exercise to confront the trauma. Next, the Commitment Tool will help you discover real facts or truths that were possible, but not included, at the time the memory was formed. This is plenty of work for today!\nTomorrow, you will use the Return to Excellence Imagery for Trauma to properly run the memory with the new truths included, which will change your emotions related to that memory.\nLet's get started.",

          "content": "In just a moment, you will confront your hard experience with the Circle Exercise. To practice, let's go through an example. While this situation is real, all the details have been changed to protect the person's identity.\nJohn was sexually abused as a child, and this continued to affect his life as an adult. He decided now was the time to work through his painful experience.\nThe Circle Exercise below looks like a clock. It starts with the Initial Moment, or the first thing that happened in his memory. Then, it moves counter-clockwise to the Next Moment (or what happens next), the Darker Moment (what happens right before the most traumatic event), and, finally, the Darkest (or most traumatic) Moment.\nWe are going to work with John's memory backwards. This means that we will start at the worst part of it—the Darkest Moment. We will then work backwards to the Darker Moment, the Next Moment and, lastly, the Initial Moment.\nIn John's Darkest Moment, he was molested by a childcare worker. Underneath the Darkest Moment outside of the Circle, John recorded his feelings, thoughts, and actions he experienced at this moment. He felt scared, his thoughts were confused, and his actions were frozen.\nGoing from the Darkest Moment clockwise, John then recorded his feelings, thoughts, and actions he had at the Darker Moment, or when the childcare worker told him that she was going to give him a bath. He recorded his feelings, thoughts, and actions of the Darker Moment outside of the Circle: He felt uneasy, his thoughts were, “I wish my mom was home,” and his actions were standing in the kitchen.\nThe Next Moment refers to what happened just prior to the Darker Moment. John had been called inside from playing with his friends. He recorded his feelings, thoughts, and actions next to the Next Moment in the circle: He was disappointed, thinking that he didn't want to go in, but he still obeyed.\nThe Initial Moment refers to what happened first, or just prior to the Next Moment. He had been playing with friends outside. John described the feelings, thoughts, and actions he experienced: He was having fun, thinking about nothing, and playing with his buddies.\nThen, John addressed the question, “What did I need?” He stated this simply. He wrote, “I needed to feel more safe.”\nNow that John had confronted his trauma, it was time for him to figure out how he could change the memory to add real facts and truth. He considered which moment was the best time to make a change in this experience.\nIn John's traumatic experience, he decided the best moment to take action would be the Darker Moment, when he was told that he had to take a bath and felt uncomfortable. He recorded his choice in the appropriate place on the Circle Exercise. This is the best place because he is in the negative experience far enough to have the emotional awareness that the situation is not healthy.\nIf John chose to change the Next Moment by never going inside the house and avoiding the situation entirely, this would not lead to much change in the strong negative emotional power of this experience. The brain needs us to begin to engage the negative emotion to make a change.\nHaving said that, you don't have to go through the entire bad experience to make a change. So, John should not go through the abuse in the imagery, and then take action after the abuse. This is not necessary and undesirable for John's well-being.\nJohn had a perfectly valid internal warning when he was in the kitchen at the Darker Moment and felt uncomfortable. It's perfect for him to address that moment differently, change how he deals with that early warning signal, and keep himself safe.\nIn this example, it was possible for John to register the bad feeling and take action early. This isn't always possible, unfortunately. Sometimes bad things are just sudden and can only be changed at or after the Darkest Moment.\nLastly, John identified the belief he had at the moment he needed to change. He described it simply: “I have to do what this person says.”\nWith these things finished, John was ready for the Commitment Tool.",

          "content": "Now, let's use the Commitment Tool to problem-solve John's negative experience and find the needed words and/or actions to make this memory more healthy.\n     1. What is going on at the moment you want to change (in John's example, the Darker Moment)?\n        My feelings were uneasy.\n        My thoughts were, “I wish my mom was home.”\n        My actions were “standing in the kitchen.”\n     2. What do I believe (at the time when the incident occurred)?\n        “I have to do what this person says.”\n     3. What's more true (with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight)?\n        “I'm going to do what is safe for me because that's what my mom would want.”\n     4. What do I need to do to make the situation more healthy?\n            A. I need to go back outside.\n            B. I need to go to my friend's house.            C. I need to tell my friend's mom, “I'm not comfortable going home,” and “I want to stay here until my mom comes home.”\nNow, with actions and words he could have said years prior, but was too afraid, John is ready to go on to Day 2, Return to Excellence Imagery for Trauma.\nWith the help of the imagery, John was able to eliminate being constantly wracked with guilt every time he remembered the experience. He also had more compassion towards himself as a young boy instead of his usual critical—even hateful—feelings and thoughts that he felt towards himself.\nAlso, he was able to more deeply understand the need for him to take care of each moment and act instead of being acted upon. He had worked with this diligently during course II, and it was powerful for him to see where he had learned to live this way.\nIf John's example does not make sense to you, additional examples are available here.",
