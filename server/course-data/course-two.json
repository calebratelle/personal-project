          "content": "In this second course—Progression Principles—we’ll support you in learning principles and tools which will help you engage challenges in the present moment with health and purpose.\nOur aim is to change the moment by engaging it better. By changing the moment, we change the day. By changing the day, we change a lifetime. A day is just a microcosm of a whole life.\nInstead of having fear or doubt overwhelm you, you will be able to calmly problem-solve life’s challenges. Your relationships with yourself, others, and your world will become healthier and more productive.\nThe Progression Principles and Tools are a series of necessary actions and interventions. The Tools are designed to assist your body and mind to stay calm and effective during moments of controversy. During this course, we will work on four Principles and their related Tools: Trust, Power, Intelligence, and Commitment.\nFor each Progression Principle, there are two main parts:\n     1. An educational component that helps you understand the Principle. The Principle is an attribute you need in your life.\n     2. A real-life application (we call them Tools) that you will use daily. The Tools include examples that are based on real people and their real lives. Using each Tool will strengthen the corresponding Progression Principle in your life and the weakness that you’re working on.\nUsing Progression Principles will help you gain skill, experience, and increased capacity to remain in a parasympathetic-dominant state when under duress. Progression Principles and Tools are the way that we have to reclaim the core strengths from weaknesses.\nThroughout this course, you will be asked to do daily work. This daily work will involve practicing therapeutic tools during your day-to-day life and keeping yourself accountable for this practice. You can expect around 15-30 minutes of work per day.",

Trust starts with yourself and valuing your own experience in your body.\nTrust is taking seriously that which you can sense or feel, but perhaps you cannot see or fully understand yet. Trust is about tuning into your experience, right here and right now. We’re going to use Trust to deal with challenges instead of settling for fear.",
