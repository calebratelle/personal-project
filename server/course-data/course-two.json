        "content": "In this second course—Progression Principles—we'll support you in learning principles and tools which will help you engage challenges in the present moment with health and purpose.\nOur aim is to change the moment by engaging it better. By changing the moment, we change the day. By changing the day, we change a lifetime. A day is just a microcosm of a whole life.\nInstead of having fear or doubt overwhelm you, you will be able to calmly problem-solve life's challenges. Your relationships with yourself, others, and your world will become healthier and more productive.\nThe Progression Principles and Tools are a series of necessary actions and interventions. The Tools are designed to assist your body and mind to stay calm and effective during moments of controversy. During this course, we will work on four Principles and their related Tools: Trust, Power, Intelligence, and Commitment.\nFor each Progression Principle, there are two main parts:\n     1. An educational component that helps you understand the Principle. The Principle is an attribute you need in your life.\n     2. A real-life application (we call them Tools) that you will use daily. The Tools include examples that are based on real people and their real lives. Using each Tool will strengthen the corresponding Progression Principle in your life and the weakness that you're working on.\nUsing Progression Principles will help you gain skill, experience, and increased capacity to remain in a parasympathetic-dominant state when under duress. Progression Principles and Tools are the way that we have to reclaim the core strengths from weaknesses.\nThroughout this course, you will be asked to do daily work. This daily work will involve practicing therapeutic tools during your day-to-day life and keeping yourself accountable for this practice. You can expect around 15-30 minutes of work per day.",

Course I gave you the background on changing the moment, and Course II will help you do it. Here we go!\nThe first Progression Principle is Trust. Trust doesn't start with other people. Trust starts with yourself and valuing your own experience in your body.\nTrust is taking seriously that which you can sense or feel, but perhaps you cannot see or fully understand yet. Trust is about tuning into your experience, right here and right now. We're going to use Trust to deal with challenges instead of settling for fear.",

For the Trust Tool, please think about a specific instance in which you avoided (i.e. your mother called you, and even though you were not busy, you did not answer the phone or call her back).\nThink of your specific weakness and a specific stressful situation.

        "content": "Let's look at an example to see the Trust Tool at work. Brenda has a real struggle with rebelling, or ignoring what's healthy and doing what she wants to do. She had been working on a project for her job for the past five hours. She began to feel like she wasn't going to be able to finish the project and was beginning to feel anxious and defeated. The rebellious part of her wanted to just force an ending to the project and be done with it. Instead, Brenda used the Trust Tool to engage in the present moment.\nStep 1 | What is going on?\nShe noticed her body was aching, especially her lower back and hip area. Then she started to feel like she wasn't succeeding in her job. Then, she started to doubt the quality of her work and felt afraid that the project wouldn't be completed. Brenda took inventory of all of this.\nStep 2 | Is it healthy or not healthy?\nBrenda recognized that how she was feeling was unhealthy. Those feelings won't help her finish the project well or help her self-esteem.\nStep 3 | What are you willing and able to do to make things more healthy?\nShe asked herself, “What do I need to feel at peace right now?” She decided to pause her work, get up from the chair, and stretch. After stretching for a few minutes, she realized she hadn't drank a glass of water in several hours. Brenda had to have the project completed by 9:00am the next morning, and it was already 11:00pm. She made a plan to get some outside air and stretch every 30 minutes to stay alert enough to finish.\nStep 4 | What assistance do you need from others? Ask for it.\nBrenda alerted her family that she would be up for a little while. Her family gave her some encouragement. Brenda finished the project by 1:00am and was proud of her ability to finish, even though she originally felt defeated. She was glad she listened to herself and trusted what her body needed.\nBrenda made a big step forward! Instead of ignoring her own body's messages, she did what she needed in order to get a physical and mental reset. This real example was a moment of quiet victory for her. She didn't rebel; instead, she felt deeply satisfied feeling the natural consequence of peace which came from listening to and respecting her simple needs.",
