Further, you'll begin to understand how fear and doubt prevent you from living at your best.\nThroughout this course, you will be asked to read, remember, reflect, and record. Some days, you will be asked to read a page or two, and journal a couple of questions. Other days, you'll listen to audio imagery and journal. You can expect around 15-30 minutes of work per day. \n This course gives you the foundation to help you understand what is going on with you—your emotions, mind, and body—when you get overwhelmed. We will make the  physiological connection to psychological symptoms. The more that we know about ourselves, the more self-aware and proactive we can be when life gets tough.",

It is a serious source of joy for us to know you will get this foundation for understanding yourself. \nYou are unique, and the rest of us actually need you to be free, and be yourself. You have a life to live and contributions to make that no one else can. This isn’t a philosophy—it’s simply true. So, let’s go! \nWhat are you struggling with right now? You’re here because something in your life is not how you want it to be. Maybe you’re feeling depressed, anxious, or stagnant. Maybe you’re having relationship troubles, or feeling isolated and empty, like you have no purpose. There are so many feelings and internal experiences that create struggle for us all. Whether we keep them tightly inside, or they spill out and make messes in our lives, these feelings and internal experiences are called your symptoms.",

Inside you, you have four innate capacities or core strengths: love, agency, change, and discernment.\nThroughout the course, we will use the terms *core strengths* and *innate capacities* interchangeably. While we will dive deeply into these tomorrow, today we will simply imagine your innate capacities as a river.\nYour core strengths are like a river running through your body. They’re always working, always on. Like a river, you can dam your innate capacities, corrupt them, pollute them, but you can’t stop them from running.\nWhen running properly, your innate capacities empower you and enable you to address challenges and fears effectively. They enable you to create a healthy life for yourself and contribute to the lives of others.\nWhat turns your natural, human core strengths into weakness? What corrupts the river?",

Even though fear is normal, fear can dominate us. Most of the symptoms that we experience come from living in a fearful state.\nHowever, fear can also be information—a sign post to rally ourselves, focus, or partner with others. Fear registers in the body as a certain kind of experience. *It is a signal to us to pay attention*.\nWhen we allow fear to simply be information, we can use our innate capacities to respond effectively. When we do this, we grow from the situation. Living with your core strengths and addressing challenges and fears as they arise enables you to live your best self.\nWhen fear dominates us, however, we misuse our core strengths. Instead, our river is corrupted and weakened. Our innate capacities turn into different forms of aggression or passiveness as we try to counteract, defeat, or evade our fear. When core strengths are compromised or corrupted by fear taking over, we experience symptoms like emptiness, anger, impatience, disinterest, depression, anxiety, etc.",

It informs us regarding what we need to address. When we use our innate capacities to address each of life’s trials individually and calmly, we don’t let fear become more than a message.
